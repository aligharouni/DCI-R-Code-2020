    # purpose: calculate paths between segments and produce sum_tab
    # Inputs: 
    #   adj_matrix
    #   passability
    #   lengths (opening the csv and replacing param)
    # Output:
    #   sum_table
    #
    # Output example: 
    #  "start","end","path2","barrier_id","pathway_pass","start_section_length","finish_section_length"
    #  "55152_s","55152_s","55152_s","NA",1,120.1,120.1

# Old Note:
#function(adj.matrix, passability) calls on "adj.matrix" and "passability" that were 
#created in previous functions.  When you call a function, it creates a bunch of 
# objects, but these objects disappear when you open a new function.  In order to 
# be able to use these objects, you can either "assign(object.name)", or you can do 
# what was done above function(object.names).  Because all of these functions are 
# called in "dci.fxs.r" and "dci.fxs.theo.restoration.r", the information is passed 
# on from one function to another.
# WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES: it creates all the data for a summary table (start and end 
# segments, pathway, barriers it goes through, passability, length of start and end
# segments)
# BUT this dataframe is NOT outputted into Excel in this function.  It's returned and 
# then called in by graph.and.data.setup.for.DCI.r.

    # why is 'lengths' used as a function param if it's declared again here -GO, 2020
